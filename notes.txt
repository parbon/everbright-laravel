Need to differentiate between users and admins in database

User Panel
  Edit additional user info
    Billing info (maybe integrate stripe or paypal instead)
  Allow writing of testimonials for public display
  Create orders

Admin panel
  Edit author info
    This will attach to blog posts
  Create/edit blog posts
  Create photo albums for users
    Upload photos to album and edit album metadata
      Generate 3 separate images: full-res, partial-res, and thumbnail
        Should these be stored externally or on disc?
    Assign photo album to user
      Allow preview (partial-res) and download options (full-res)
    Option to enable public view of album for web gallery display
      Perhaps make separate public version of album with specific photos

Order functionality
  Shopping cart
    Include custom items in this list
  Email notifications when order status changes (custom work becomes available)
    Possible text notifications if enabled as well through Twilio (0.0075 USD per text)
